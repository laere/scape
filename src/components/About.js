        <p>Scape is a web application using the Runescape API that allows users to look up monsters, personal hiscores, grand exchange information and more!</p>

        <p>I created this site, because I absolutely have enjoyed 15 years (with some breaks) of Runescape</p>

        <p>
          I started playing Runescape in 2001, and immediately enjoyed it's skilling system and combat. It also was a very social game as the
          GE didn't exist back then, so you had to go to popular worlds, and cities within to find players selling what you were buying and vice versa. This also established
          economical partnerships between people and friendships in general.

          Runescape reached it's peak in 2007-2009, in my opinion. Runescape 2 was amazing, and having mass wilderness PK battles between clans was absolutely awesome. Nothing like
          having 100+ people in the wildy just going at it. And more. Overall it was just a great time for Runescape, and I had a lot of friends to play with at the time.

          I think today Runescape has evolved greatly, it's still a great game, but like every game it has it's faults. EOC I think is sort of killed the combat that made runescape so fun.
          MTX is a typical cash grab, and although I loved that Jagex brought back OSRS servers, but it split the community in half, and Runescape has always had an amazing community.

          All in all I still enjoy Runescape, and it's still my first MMO ever, so I do have a bit of bias.
