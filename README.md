Runescape has been a big part of my life as a kid growing up.

I started Runescape in 2001 during classic under the name Strikerx15. I was ranked 4 on top attack exp,
and in the top 20 for overall skills for almost half a year. I played it as much as I could until I left the game in 2007.

However, I couldn't stay away, and came back for a short time in 2009-2010 to do summoning, then again quit.

Now it's 2016, and I have started playing again. Although I don't play OSRS, I have been enjoying RS3. Runescape is one game I hate starting over in.
But, maybe I will start a new OSRS character sometime in the future.

This project is being able to combine my love for creating web applications with my love for the game I grew up with. This application
will be along the lines of a pokedex/wikipedia combination. Players can look up others high scores, monster information, and whats hot on the grand exchange within the game.

I really want to make this project into something big, so here is for those that enjoy the game as much as I do!

Cheers.


<h1>Things to do</h1>

Need to make some utility functions to reduce repeated code.

Need to create more pure, functional components to stop repeated components.

Need to proxy my requests since to avoid origin header errors (using cors extension for now).
